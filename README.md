# ArtDemo
 Two visual simulations "interconnected" and "boids" each with their own unqiue feeling and customizations
 
## Interconnected
 Creating random dynamic visual graphs with random node and velocity position connected with coloured edges with multiple themes and starting configuarations

## Boids
 Recreated and expanded on a classic boids simulation allowing for multiple classes (the same type of boid only flock with eachother)

### Running
 Open the ArtTest folder within Unity, the main menu is the first page
  The interconnected button is used to see the interconnected demo
  The boids demo needs to be opened in the scene manually as the button isn't configured yet
