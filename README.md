# ArtDemo
 Two visual simulations "interconnected" and "boids" each with their own unqiue feeling and customizations
 
## Interconnected
 Creating random dynamic visual graphs with random node and velocity position connected with coloured edges with multiple themes and starting configuarations

## Boids
 Recreated and expanded on a classic boids simulation allowing for multiple classes (the same type of boid only flock with eachother)
 Note: Doesn't work from the main menu, manually need to adjust the scene from the inspector
